**How to Test API Endpoints with Different User Roles (e.g., Normal User, Sales User, Super User):**

1. Update Credentials in Fixture File:
First, go to the fixture file named api_for_different_user_login.json and update it with the username and password of the user role you want to test.
For example, if you're testing as a Normal User, enter the Normal Userâ€™s credentials in this file.

2. Run Tests Based on User Role Using Tags:
Once you've set the appropriate credentials, you can run the tests for that specific user role using tags.
For example, to run tests for the Normal User, use the following command:

**User Credentials**
**ðŸ‘¤ Normal User**
Email: testnew.prd@crowdbotics.com

Password: Test@123456789

**ðŸ’¼ Sales User**
Email: vinay.sales@crowdbotics.com
