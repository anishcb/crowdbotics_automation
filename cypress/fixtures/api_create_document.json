    "description": "Generate a Business Requirements Document (BRD) from the uploaded PRD and business strategy documents. The BRD should outline the core business objectives, functional requirements, and expected outcomes of the product. Include key performance indicators (KPIs) that will measure success, and specify any dependencies or constraints that may impact the project. This document will be used for review by stakeholders to ensure alignment on business goals and project scope before development begins."
