{The 'AI-generated personalized meal plans' feature in the 'Culinary Canvas' app leverages advanced artificial intelligence to create customized meal plans tailored to individual user preferences, dietary restrictions, and nutritional goals. This feature simplifies meal planning by analyzing user activity, saved recipes, and dietary inputs to generate a balanced and diverse meal plan for a specified time period (e.g., daily, weekly). Users can further refine the meal plans by adjusting serving sizes, swapping recipes, or adding their own recipes. This feature aims to enhance user convenience, promote healthy eating habits, and inspire culinary creativity.}
